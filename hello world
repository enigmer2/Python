//Your First Program

//Let's start off by creating a short program that displays "Hello world!".
//In Python, we use the print statement to output text.
//Tap Try It Yourself and see it in action:
print('Hello world!')
//Try It Yourself

//Congratulations! You have written your first program.

//The print statement needs to be followed by parentheses, which enclose the output we want to generate.
//Run, save and share your Python code on our Code Playground without installing any additional software.
