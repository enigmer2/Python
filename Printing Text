//Printing Text

//The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text.

//For Example:
print('Hello world!')
print('Hello world!')
print('Spam and eggs...')
//Try It Yourself

//Each print statement outputs text from a new line.
//Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python.
//This is why the words, "spam" and "eggs" are often used as placeholder 
//variables in Python where "foo" and "bar" would be used in other programming languages.
